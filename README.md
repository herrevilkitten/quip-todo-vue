# Vue ToDo
This is a version of the classic "To Do List" that is often used to compare different frameworks and such (for even more examples, see http://todomvc.com/).  This simple app lets you add items to a list, mark them as completed, and remove them.  It stores the item information using Quip Records.

## Important Information

Check out my [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/herrevilkitten/quip-getting-started-vue) for detailed information on what changes are made and important caveats.

## Installation
```
